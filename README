AntiTEMPO is a bunch of C# libraries that I developed during the last couple of years of my graduate school. Initially it was not intended to be published. Now I think some of the code might be useful to others. 
Although documentation is virtually not present, I will try to comment the code.
You can use the code as you please, some parts of the code is inspired by GNU scientific libraries or the numerical recipes in C.
